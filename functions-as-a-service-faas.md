# Functions as a Service (FaaS)

Functions as a Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing service model that enables developers to run individual functions or small scripts in a fully managed environment without the need to provision and manage infrastructure. This service model is also known as serverless computing, as the underlying infrastructure is abstracted away from the developer and only the function code is managed by the developer.

### Brief History

The concept of FaaS was first introduced by AWS in 2014, with the launch of AWS Lambda. Since then, other major cloud providers such as Google Cloud (Cloud Functions), Microsoft Azure (Azure Functions), and IBM (IBM Cloud Functions) have also introduced their own FaaS offerings.

FaaS gained popularity in recent years as it allows for a more cost-effective and scalable way of running applications, as the infrastructure is only used when the function is executed. This eliminates the need for developers to provision and manage infrastructure, and allows them to focus on writing and deploying their functions.

### Principles of FaaS

FaaS operates on the principles of event-driven computing and microservices. Functions are triggered by events such as a new file being added to a storage bucket, a message being published to a message queue, or a direct invocation through an API call. Each function runs in its own isolated environment, which allows for high scalability and low overhead.

The FaaS platform also provides automatic scaling, where additional containers are spun up as the number of requests to a function increases, and terminated as the number of requests decreases, to save resources.

### Inner workings of FaaS

FaaS is built on top of a containerization technology such as Docker, where each function runs in its own isolated environment. This allows for high scalability and low overhead as the infrastructure is only used when the function is executed.

When a function is triggered, either through an event or a direct invocation, the FaaS platform spins up a container to execute the function. Once the function execution is completed, the container is terminated, and the resources are freed up for other functions to use.

### Mechanisms

FaaS uses several mechanisms to provide a seamless and fully managed service. One of the key mechanisms is the use of triggers, which are used to invoke a function. Triggers can be events such as a new file being added to a storage bucket, a message being published to a message queue, or a direct invocation through an API call.

Another key mechanism used in FaaS is automatic scaling. As the number of requests to a function increases, the FaaS platform automatically spins up additional containers to handle the load, and as the number of requests decreases, the platform terminates the excess containers to save resources.

### Protocols and Technical Implementations

FaaS uses standard protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS for function invocation and communication. When a function is invoked, the FaaS platform receives an HTTP or HTTPS request and routes it to the appropriate function container. The function code then processes the request and returns the result in the form of an HTTP or HTTPS response.

FaaS also utilizes other technologies such as load balancers and reverse proxies to distribute incoming requests and route them to the appropriate function containers. This allows for high availability and low latency, as requests can be routed to the closest function container.

### Pros and Cons

FaaS offers several advantages, such as:

* Cost-effective as the infrastructure is only used when the function is executed
* High scalability as the number of containers can be automatically increased or decreased
* Event-driven computing and microservices allow for efficient and fast processing
* No need to provision and manage infrastructure

However, FaaS also has some limitations, such as:

* Limited control over the underlying infrastructure
* Cold starts (the initial delay when a container is spun up) may cause latency
* Limited to stateless functions
* Limited support for certain languages

### Conclusion

FaaS provides a cost-effective and scalable way for developers to run their code without the need to provision and manage infrastructure. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and allows developers to focus on writing and deploying their functions. With automatic scaling, built-in triggers, and standard protocols, FaaS is a powerful tool for building and deploying event-driven applications and microservices.
