  Event-driven computing is a programming paradigm that allows systems to
  respond to specific events or triggers in real-time, rather than running on a
  predefined schedule or polling for data.

# Event Driven computing

Event-driven computing allows for a more dynamic and efficient use of resources, as the system only runs when there is an actual need for it.

## Mechanisms behind event-driven computing

There are several mechanisms behind event-driven computing, including:

* Event loops: An event loop is a central component of event-driven systems that listens for incoming events and schedules them for processing. This allows the system to handle multiple events concurrently, improving performance and scalability.
* Event queues: Events are typically stored in an event queue, where they are held until they can be processed by the event loop. This allows the system to handle bursts of incoming events, and helps to ensure that no events are lost.
* Event handlers: An event handler is a function or piece of code that responds to a specific event. Event handlers are typically registered with the event loop, and are invoked when the corresponding event is received.
* Event buses: An event bus is a messaging infrastructure that allows different components of a system to communicate with each other using events. Event buses can be used to decouple different components of a system, improving scalability and flexibility.

## Implementation

Event-driven computing can be implemented using various programming languages and frameworks. For example, in C++, the Boost.Asio library can be used to create and manage asynchronous operations, such as message passing and event-driven programming. In Python, the asyncio library can be used to create and manage asynchronous tasks and events.

## Algorithms and data structures

Event-driven systems can be implemented using a variety of algorithms and data structures, such as:

* Observer pattern: This is a behavioural design pattern that allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects. It is often used in event-driven systems to implement event-based communication between different components of a system.
* Reactor pattern: This is a behavioural design pattern that allows a system to respond to external events in a non-blocking way. It is often used in event-driven systems to implement the event loop and event handlers.
* Publish-subscribe pattern: This is a messaging pattern that allows different components of a system to communicate with each other using events. It is often used in event-driven systems to implement the event bus and event queue.

Event-driven computing is a powerful programming paradigm that allows systems to respond to real-world events in real-time, improving performance, scalability, and efficiency. It is widely used in a variety of systems, such as web applications, microservices, and IoT.
