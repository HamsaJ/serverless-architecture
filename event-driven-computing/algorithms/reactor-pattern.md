# Reactor pattern

Reactor pattern is an event-driven architecture that is commonly used in systems that handle high-concurrency and high-performance scenarios, such as network servers, web applications, and real-time systems.

The main component of the reactor pattern is the reactor, which is responsible for managing the event handlers and dispatching the events to the appropriate handlers. The reactor is typically implemented as a single thread or a small number of threads, which handle the events in a non-blocking way. This allows the system to handle a large number of events simultaneously without blocking or slowing down the system.

The reactor pattern uses the observer pattern internally to handle the registration and deregistration of event handlers. Event handlers are registered with the reactor, and the reactor uses an observer pattern to notify the appropriate event handlers when an event occurs.

The reactor pattern is implemented with a combination of different algorithms and data structures. The most common data structure used in the reactor pattern is the event queue, which is used to store the incoming events. The event queue is typically implemented as a priority queue, which allows the reactor to prioritize the handling of events based on their importance.

The reactor pattern uses the select() system call on the POSIX systems, epoll() on Linux, and the completion ports on Windows, to monitor the events. These APIs allow the reactor to efficiently monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets, pipes, etc.) and react to the events in a non-blocking way.

One of the main advantages of the reactor pattern is its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections and events in a non-blocking way, which improves the performance and scalability of the system. It also enables a more efficient use of system resources, as the reactor can handle many events simultaneously without blocking the system.

However, the reactor pattern also has some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be difficult to implement and debug, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying system and the algorithms and data structures used in the implementation. Additionally, the reactor pattern can be difficult to test and maintain, as it involves a complex interplay between multiple components and threads.

Here is an example of the reactor pattern implemented in Python:

```python
class Reactor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handlers = {}
    
    def register_handler(self, event_type, handler):
        self.handlers[event_type] = handler
        
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event.type in self.handlers:
            self.handlers[event.type](event)
    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            event = get_next_event()
            self.handle_event(event)

class Event:
    def __init__(self, event_type, data):
        self.type = event_type
        self.data = data

def event_handler_1(event):
    print("Event type: ", event.type)
    print("Event data: ", event.data)

def event_handler_2(event):
    print("Event type: ", event.type)
    print("Event data: ", event.data)

reactor = Reactor()
reactor.register_handler("event_1", event_handler_1)
reactor.register_handler("event_2", event_handler_2)
reactor.run()
```

In this example, the `Reactor` class is the main component of the reactor pattern. It has a dictionary called `handlers` that stores the event handlers, and a method `register_handler` that allows you to register an event handler for a specific event type. The `handle_event` method takes an event as an argument and dispatches it to the appropriate event handler. The `run` method is a infinite loop that waits for events and handles them as they arrive.

The `Event` class is a simple class that holds the event data and the event type. In this example, the `event_handler_1` and `event_handler_2` functions are the event handlers that are registered with the reactor for handling "event\_1" and "event\_2" respectively.

In this example, the `get_next_event()` function is a placeholder function that should be implemented to retrieve the next event from the event queue. It could be a simple polling loop, or a more advanced mechanism like select(), epoll(), or completion ports.

In the last line of the code we are creating an instance of the reactor, registering two handlers for event\_1 and event\_2 and running the infinite loop of the reactor.

This is a simple example of the reactor pattern, but in a real-world application, the `Reactor` class would likely have additional methods for starting and stopping the event loop, and for handling errors and cleanup. Additionally, the event handling logic would likely be more complex, with multiple event types and handlers, and may include additional data structures and algorithms for managing the events and handlers.

In summary, the reactor pattern is a powerful concurrency design pattern that is commonly used in high-performance and high-concurrency systems such as network servers and real-time systems. It improves the performance and scalability of the system by handling events in a non-blocking and asynchronous way, but it can be difficult to implement, debug, and maintain.
