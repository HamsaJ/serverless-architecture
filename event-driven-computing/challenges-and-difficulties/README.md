# Challenges and difficulties

There are certain pain points that need to be taken into account when designing and implementing event-driven systems. In this article, we will discuss some of the main pain points of event-driven computing and how to address them.

1. Complexity: One of the main pain points of event-driven computing is the added complexity that it brings to the system. With event-driven systems, there are multiple components that need to be coordinated and managed, such as event queues, event handlers, and event buses. This can make it difficult to understand the flow of data and control flow in the system, especially when dealing with large and complex systems.
2. Debugging and testing: Event-driven systems can also be difficult to debug and test. This is because events can be triggered by multiple sources, and the flow of data can be hard to trace. Additionally, because events are typically asynchronous, it can be difficult to reproduce bugs and test edge cases.
3. Race conditions: Event-driven systems can also be prone to race conditions, which occur when two or more threads access shared data simultaneously, leading to unexpected results. This can be a particular problem when dealing with highly concurrent systems, where multiple events can be processed at the same time.
4. Scalability: Event-driven systems can also be challenging to scale. This is because events need to be processed in real-time, and there can be a high volume of events to process. Additionally, as the number of events and subscribers increases, the complexity of managing the system also increases.
5. Latency: Latency is another pain point in event-driven systems, as it can be difficult to ensure that events are processed in a timely manner. This is particularly true for systems that need to process real-time data, such as financial systems, where latency can have a significant impact on the performance of the system.
6. Idempotency: Another pain point of event-driven computing is ensuring idempotency, which means that an operation should have the same effect whether it is executed once or multiple times. In event-driven systems, messages can be delivered multiple times due to network failures, system crashes, or other reasons. This can lead to duplicate processing, which can cause inconsistencies in the system. To address this, it is important to implement idempotency mechanisms, such as deduplication or versioning, to ensure that duplicate messages are not processed. Additionally, it is important to have a clear understanding of the system's requirements for idempotency and to design the system accordingly.
7. Event flooding is a phenomenon that occurs in event-driven systems when the rate of incoming events exceeds the system's capacity to handle them, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed events and a decrease in system performance. This can lead to a domino effect, where the system becomes overwhelmed and unable to handle even more events, resulting in a complete system failure.

To address these pain points, it is important to have a clear understanding of the system requirements and design a system that is modular, testable, and scalable. Additionally, it is important to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to manage the event queues, and to use appropriate testing and debugging tools to ensure that the system is working correctly.&#x20;
